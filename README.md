- 👋 Hi, I’m Stephen!
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and visualisation, automation, micro computers and IoT.
- 🌱 I’m currently dabbling with geospatial data and visualisation of the data in large Dash projects.

I like messing about with Raspberry Pi and trying to come up with interesting ways to use them.
I mainly code in Python.
