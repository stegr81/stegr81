- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stephen!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analysis and visualisation, automation, micro computers and IoT.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently dabbling with geospatial data and visualisatio of the data for analysis in Dash and recognition and classification models.

I like messing about with Raspberry Pi and trying to come up with interesting ways to use them.
I mainly code in Python.
